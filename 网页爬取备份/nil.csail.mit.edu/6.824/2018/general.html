<p><h2>Structure</h2>

<p>6.824 is a core graduate subject with
lectures, labs, an optional project, a mid-term exam, and a final exam.
6.824 is 12 units.  6 EDPs.
</p>

<p>Class meets TR1-2:30 in 54-100.  Most class
meetings will be part lecture and part paper discussion.  You
should read the paper <i>before</i> coming to class, and be prepared
to discuss it. You can find out what paper to read for each meeting in
the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>.

<p>
We will post a question about each paper 24 hours before
the beginning of class.
Your answer need only be long enough to demonstrate that
you understand the paper; a paragraph or two will usually be enough.
We won't give feedback, but we will glance at your answers to make
sure they make sense, and they will contribute to your grade.
For each lecture you must also submit your own question about the
paper.

<p>6.824 will have a midterm exam during the ordinary leture time,
  and a final exam during finals week.
  There will be no alternate conflict time for the midterm exam.

<p>There are programming labs due every week or two throughout the term.
These labs are to be done by students individually.

<p>Towards the end of the term you can choose between doing a final
<a href="http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2018/project.html">project</a> based on your own ideas or doing <a href="labs/lab-shard.html">Lab 4</a>.  If you
want to pursue your own idea, you must form a team of two or
three people, the project must involve ideas covered in 6.824,
and we must approve it. You'll hand in a short project proposal, and,
if we approve, you'll design and build a system; at the end of the
term you'll hand in a summary of your results and do a short
presentation and demo in class.

<p>
To do well in 6.824, you should already be familiar with computer
systems to the level of 6.033 and 6.004, and you should be good at
debugging, implementing, and designing software, perhaps as a result
of taking programming-intensive courses such as 6.828 and 6.035.

<!-- RULE: grading -->

<p><h2>Grading</h2>

Final course grades will be based on: <br>
<UL>
    <LI>50% labs (programming assignments), including optional project
    <LI>20% mid-term exam
    <LI>20% final exam
    <li>10% paper question answers and your own questions about papers
</UL>

<p>Historically 6.824 has required lots of work, but students do well;
typically more than half of the students receive an A- or higher.

<p>
In order to help you cope with unexpected emergencies,
you can hand in your lab solutions late, but the total amount of
lateness summed over all the deadlines must not exceed 72 hours. If
you don't hand in an assignment by the
last day of classes, we'll give the assignment an F. If you hand an
assignment in late, and your total late time (including the late time
for that assignment) exceeds 72 hours, and you hand it in by the last
day of classes, then we'll give it a D or an F depending on whether it
seems to basically work. You can divide up your 72 hours among the
labs however you like; you don't have to ask or tell us. You can only
use the 72 hours for the labs; for example, you are not allowed to use
late hours for any aspect of the project. If you want an exception to
these rules, please ask S3 to send us an excuse note.

<hr>

<p><h2>Collaboration policy</h2>

<p>
You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments,
except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are
not allowed to look at anyone else's solution (and you're not allowed
to look at solutions from previous years). You may discuss the
assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use
each other's code.

<p>
Please do not publish your code or make
it available to current or future 6.824 students.
<tt>github.com</tt> repositories are public by default, so please
don't put your code there unless you make the repository private. You
may find it convenient to use
<a href="https://github.mit.edu/">MIT's GitHub</a>,
but be sure to create a private repository.

<p>
You may discuss the paper questions with other
students, but you may not look at other students' answers.  You must
write your answers yourself.
